# Electrotechnique Industrielle: A Classic Textbook on Electrical Engineering
 
Electrotechnique Industrielle is a textbook written by Guy SÃ©guier and Francis Notelet, two French engineers and professors of electrical engineering. The book covers the fundamentals and applications of electrical engineering, such as circuits, machines, power systems, electronics, and control. The book was first published in 1977 by Technique et documentation[^2^], and has been revised and updated several times since then. The latest edition was published in 1994 by TEC et Doc[^1^], and has 484 pages.
 
The book is intended for students and practitioners of electrical engineering, as well as for anyone interested in learning more about the field. The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous examples, exercises, and illustrations. The book also includes references to other books and articles for further reading. The book is divided into four parts: Part I: Generalities, Part II: Electrical Machines, Part III: Power Systems, and Part IV: Electronics and Control.

Electrical engineering has many subfields and specialties, each with its own theoretical foundations, methods, tools, and applications. Some of the major subfields of electrical engineering are:
 
- **Circuit analysis**: The study of the behavior and properties of electric circuits composed of various elements, such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors, and operational amplifiers. Circuit analysis involves applying mathematical techniques, such as Kirchhoff's laws, Ohm's law, Thevenin's theorem, and Fourier series, to solve for the voltages and currents in a circuit.
- **Electrical machines**: The study of the principles and operation of devices that convert electrical energy into mechanical energy or vice versa. Electrical machines include generators, motors, transformers, and alternators. Electrical machines involve applying concepts such as magnetic fields, electromagnetic induction, torque, and power factor.
- **Power systems**: The study of the generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electric power on a large scale. Power systems involve analyzing and designing components and networks that deliver electric power from power plants to consumers. Power systems involve applying concepts such as load flow, fault analysis, stability, protection, and optimization.
- **Electronics**: The study of the design and application of electronic circuits and devices that manipulate signals or information. Electronics include analog electronics, digital electronics, microelectronics, nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and quantum electronics. Electronics involve applying concepts such as semiconductor physics, logic gates, integrated circuits, amplifiers, filters, oscillators, modulators, demodulators, converters, sensors, and actuators.
- **Signals and systems**: The study of the representation and processing of signals or information using mathematical models and techniques. Signals are physical quantities that vary with time or space or both. Systems are devices or processes that perform some operations on signals. Signals and systems involve applying concepts such as linear systems theory,
Fourier analysis,
Laplace transform,
Z-transform,
sampling theorem,
convolution,
correlation,
filtering,
modulation,
coding,
and compression.
- **Control systems**: The study of the design and analysis of systems that automatically regulate their behavior or performance according to some desired objectives or criteria. Control systems involve applying concepts such as feedback,
feedforward,
open-loop,
closed-loop,
stability,
robustness,
optimality,
and adaptivity.
- **Communication systems**: The study of the transmission and reception of signals or information over various media or channels. Communication systems involve applying concepts such as modulation,
demodulation,
multiplexing,
encoding,
decoding,
error correction,
encryption,
decryption,
compression,
decompression,
and synchronization.
- **Computer engineering**: The study of the design and application of computer hardware and software systems that perform various functions or tasks. Computer engineering involves applying concepts such as computer architecture,
microprocessors,
memory,
input/output devices,
operating systems,
programming languages,
compilers,
algorithms,
data structures,
databases,
networks,
security,
and artificial intelligence.

Electrical engineering is a dynamic and evolving field that constantly incorporates new discoveries and innovations from other disciplines such as physics, mathematics, chemistry
