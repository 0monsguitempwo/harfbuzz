In this guide, we will provide you with a comprehensive list of soul shields available in Blade and Soul, as well as some tips on how to choose and upgrade them. We will also cover some of the best soul shield combinations for different classes and situations.
 
## How to Choose and Upgrade Soul Shields
 
Choosing the right soul shield for your character depends on several factors, such as your class, role, gear level, content type, and personal preference. Generally speaking, you want to look for soul shields that provide attributes that are relevant and beneficial for your class and build. For example, if you are a DPS class, you might want to prioritize critical rate, critical damage, accuracy, and attack power. If you are a tank class, you might want to focus on HP, defense, evasion, and threat.
 
Another factor to consider is the set bonus of the soul shield. Some sets offer more useful bonuses than others, depending on the situation. For example, some sets might give you extra damage against certain enemies or bosses, or increase your survivability or utility in certain scenarios. You can check the set bonus of a soul shield by hovering over its icon in your inventory or soul shield tab.

Once you have chosen a soul shield set that suits your needs, you can upgrade it by using soul shield primers. Soul shield primers are items that can be used to enhance the attributes of a soul shield fragment. You can obtain primers from various sources, such as crafting with the Soul Warden profession, buying from merchants or marketplaces, or exchanging with certain NPCs or currencies.
 
To upgrade a soul shield fragment with a primer, you need to fuse them together in the soul shield tab. You can only fuse primers that have the same or higher quality than the fragment you want to upgrade. The result of the fusion will depend on the quality and type of the primer. For example, if you use a critical primer on a fragment that already has critical rate as an attribute, it will increase its value. If you use a critical primer on a fragment that does not have critical rate as an attribute, it will add it as a new attribute.
 
Fusing primers will consume gold and fusion powder, which is a material that can be obtained by salvaging unwanted soul shield fragments. You can also use fusion charms to increase the success rate of the fusion process. Fusion charms can be bought from merchants or marketplaces, or obtained from events or achievements.
