Train Simulator and Train Sim World 3 are both developed by Dovetail Games, a British company that specializes in simulation games. They have been creating train simulation games since 2009, and have a loyal fan base of train enthusiasts and gamers. They also have other simulation games, such as Fishing Sim World and Euro Fishing.
 
Train Simulator is the older game of the two, and it has over 400 add-ons available on Steam. You can choose from a variety of trains, routes, scenarios, and workshops. You can also create your own custom content and share it with other players. Train Simulator uses the RailWorks engine, which is designed to simulate realistic physics and graphics.
 
Train Sim World 3 is the newer game of the two, and it was released in 2020. It uses the Unreal Engine 4, which allows for more immersive and dynamic gameplay. You can explore the world from different perspectives, such as the driver's seat, the passenger's view, or the free roam mode. You can also interact with various objects and systems in the game, such as doors, switches, and signals. Train Sim World 3 has fewer add-ons than Train Simulator, but they are more detailed and diverse.

Both Train Simulator and Train Sim World 3 have their own advantages and disadvantages. Train Simulator has more content and customization options, but it also has more technical issues and outdated graphics. Train Sim World 3 has better graphics and gameplay, but it also has less content and higher system requirements. Ultimately, the choice depends on your personal preference and budget.
 
In conclusion, Train Simulator: DB BR 411 'ICE-T' EMU Add-On is a great DLC pack for Train Simulator fans who want to drive the German high-speed train on various routes. However, it is not available for PS4 users, who will have to settle for Train Sim World 3 or wait for a PS4 version of the add-on or the game. Both games are realistic and enjoyable train simulation games that offer different experiences and features. If you are interested in train simulation games, you should check them out and see which one suits you better.
